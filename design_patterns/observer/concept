There is a subject which is the Observable, and there is another subject which is the Observer.
The Observable keeps track of all its Observers, and uses them to notify, or do some task.

Ex: Notify button when an iPhone is out of stock in Amazon.
The iPhone is the Observable, and the users are the Observers, meaning the users want to get notified when the
iPhone is in-stock.
We can have two types of concrete Observer class for this:
1. EmailAlertObserver
2. SMSAlertObserver

Its upto the user to select the method of notification.

The Observable should have these methods:
1. add(): To add the observer
2. remove(): To remove the observer
3. notify(): To iterate over all the observers, and call their update() method
4. set_data(): To set the new data of the Observable, and then notify the observers.

The Observer should have these methods:
1. update(): We use the business logic here to send the notification depending upon the notification type.
