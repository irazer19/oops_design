Factory pattern:

Lets say you have a class Vehicle from which there are MercedesVehicle and BMWVehicle concrete class.
Now if there is a class called VehicleFactory which on the basis on some condition creates either MercedesVehicle or
BMWVehicle, then thats a factory design pattern.

Abstract Factory pattern

This is same as Factory pattern except that we have Factory of Factory.
Ex: Lets say we have a VehicleFactory class which on some condition creates either a LuxuryFactory or OrdinaryFactory,
and then the LuxuryFactory on the basis on some condition creates either MercedesVehicle or BMWVehicle, then its
called Abstract Factory pattern.
