Network Protocols:

Application layer:
1. Client server protocol
    1. http - 1 connection
    2. ftp - 2 connections, data and control connections.
    3. smtp - to send the email
    4. web sockets
2. Peer to peer protocol
    1. webRTC: Uses UDP because its used in real time video conferencing.


Client server:
Client makes a request and the server responds back, its a one way communication.
Web socket is slightly different because its bidirectional but its still not a peer to peer.
In web socket, the client sends the data to server which sends to another client and vice-versa.

SMTP: To send the email
IMAP: To receive the email

Peer to Peer:
All the clients and servers can communicate with each other.

Transport / Network layer:
1. TCP/IP: We maintain a virtual connection through which data is sent, therefore ordering of the packets is
            maintained. If there is no acknowledgement from the receiver then it again sends the same packet.
2. UDP/IP: No connection is maintained here, the data is sent parallely without any order of the packets, the
            advantage is that its faster than TCP because we dont maintain connection or do acknowledgements.
