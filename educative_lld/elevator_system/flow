1. First all the objects are created such as buttons, doors, elevator car, etc.
2. Now we present an interactive terminal where the user can input the floor where it wants to be at.
3. Next, the user will select the button to either go UP or DOWN.
4. We assume the user has entered the elevator, and now the user selects the floor number button from the
elevator panel.
5. The elevator reaches the floor, and opens the door and exits.

Behind the scenes:
1. When the user selects the floor from where it wants to begin, we store that object in the dictionary.
2. Then the user presses either the UP/DOWN button from the Hall panel, we store this data, and change the state
of this button, and then call a callback function of the ElevatorSystem class called disptacher() to select the
best elevator car for this request by providing the floor no, and direction of the button.
3. The dispatcher gets the best Elevator car, and then it unpressed the hall button, and then the ElevatorSystem
opens the door of the ElevatorCar, and move() the ElevatorCar until it floor no == the user selected floor.
The ElevatorSystem now opens the door and then closes again through the ElevatorButton object.
